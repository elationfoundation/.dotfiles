# for $deity's sake, check that anything we're getting is complete and sane on a regular basis
# It seems git's default behavior in many situations is -- despite communicating objectID by
# content-addressable hashes which should be sufficient to assure some integrity -- it may not actually bother to *check* them.
# Yes, even when receiving objects from other repos.
# So, enabling these configuration parameters may "slow down" your git operations.
# (Anecdotally, I'd say "no it bloody won't"; I've had them on for months now and pretty much forget they were there.)
# The return is actually noticing if someone ships you a bogus object.  Everyone should enable these.
